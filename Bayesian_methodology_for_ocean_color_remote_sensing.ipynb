      "   --> A definition and implementation of numerical approximations of the expectation and covariance of the posterior distribution, i.e. a complete Bayesian solution. This is developed for the marine reflectance as well as for the atmospheric parameters. These quantities are retrieved simultaneously from the TOA reflectance. Measures of uncertainties are provided along with the retrievals.\n",
